Texture 0 - An array texture where each texture is of a particular size (default 16 x 16), the ID of the block is used to index into it
Texture 1 - Chunk index texture, each pixel consists of one unsigned byte, which corresponds to the ID of the texture from the texture array to use

The block textures are compiled into the software. There is a prededined symbol (the array of chars starting with the underscore) corresponding the the textures in memory.
The textures are preprocessed into one block of raw data, one texture after another. This can then be loaded with a single driver call.
The name of the symbols to access data can be found by running objdump -f on the generated object file
For static linking SDL, the libraries to link can be found by running SDL_CONFIG with the --static option

Note: In order to tell

Todo: - Improve terrain generation to stop inside faces from being drawn. Also: combine adjacent faces
      - Move trees to preprocessing stage as they are slow to generate
      - Find a better way to handle transparency
